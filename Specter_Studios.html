                    <h2>Specter Studios<br /></h2>
                    <p>This project was a study on brand identity.
                        I began created a company in the service industry.
                        Specter Studios is a company in the video effects industry as a new and upcoming studio.
                        The process started with developing what the company was all about, getting a feeling for their vision and purpose.
                        I wanted the identity to have a playful and creative emphasis while keeping a strong sense of professionalism and detail.
                        From there I went through several iterations before landing on a finished logo.
                        The logo consists of 4 curved teardrop shaped marks that work together to form a circle in the white space.
                        The abstract mark can be seen as small ghosts or a camera shutter.
                        But it is ultimately derived from multiple Sâ€™s perpendicular to each other.
                        I chose Century Gothic for the type because the equality and symmetry between the forms gave a solid sophisticated form.
                        But the perfect circles in certain letter forms helped to add that touch of playfulness.
                        Finally, the logo was put into context with real world mockups and an animated video.
