                <h2>Folkways Album Cover<br /></h2>
                <p>The Smithsonian Folkways is a collection of music and sounds across generations that preserves music and life into the future.
                    The goal of this project was to use illustration to create an album cover for a selection of folkways records.
                    The selected music was a duo of blue jazz and ragtime jazz. The colorful shapes illustrated onto the album cover were a play on synesthesia.
                    The visualization of the music being bright and sharp for the ragtime contrasts with the curvilinear and blue colors for the blues.
                    This concept was combined with a typeface I created specifically for this project named Bodoni Jazz.
                    The final product is a colorful album cover that invites the owner of such a record to step into the past of jazz.

        <p>With an identity established I went through several iterations before landing on a finished logo.
            The final mark began as an abstract use of the letter S in four directions.
            The logo consists of 4 curved teardrop shaped abstract marks.
            The abstract mark can be seen as small ghosts or a camera shutter utilizing the circular whitespace in the marks center.
            I chose Century Gothic for the type because the equality and symmetry between the forms gave a solid sophisticated form.
            But the perfect circles in certain letter forms helped to add that touch of playfulness.
            Finally, the logo was put into context with real world mockups and
