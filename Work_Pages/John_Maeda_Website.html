        <h2>John Maeda Designer Website<br /></h2>
        <p>This project was meant to showcase a designer by embodying their values and art and immersing the viewer in their work.
          I chose John Maeda as the designer because the things he has created are not only visually compelling but have pushed
          the boundaries of design and technology forward. There was a strong focus on the UX/UI in this project. Through lots of
          research on John Maeda and hours spent admiring his work I created this website to showcase him. There are separate pages
          for the home, about, philosophy, work and contact. Fluid animations play a large part in signifying the user
          throughout the website. Each page has a backdrop of animated digital lines. These represent the mathematical and coded work that Maeda did.
          The project successfully told a story about John Maeda and his values as a designer while embracing a pleasant and simplistic website design.

    <p>With an identity established I went through several iterations before landing on a finished logo.
      The final mark began as an abstract use of the letter S in four directions.
      The logo consists of 4 curved teardrop shaped abstract marks.
      The abstract mark can be seen as small ghosts or a camera shutter utilizing the circular whitespace in the marks center.
      I chose Century Gothic for the type because the equality and symmetry between the forms gave a solid sophisticated form.
      But the perfect circles in certain letter forms helped to add that touch of playfulness.
      Finally, the logo was put into context with real world mockups and an <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/Oib6Qzoqb5c?si=0kjltilj656XYhBw" target="_blank">animated video.</a>
