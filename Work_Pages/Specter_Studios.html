                    <p>This project was a study on brand identity.
                        The project required me to create a company in the service industry.
                        Specter Studios is a company in the video effects industry as a new and upcoming studio.
                        The process begins by developing what the company was all about, getting a feeling for their vision and purpose.
                        Specter Studios is a group of artists who emphasize creativity and risk taking. They balance this with a strong sense of attention to detail.
                        The company has a playful and fun feeling while also appealing to the professionalism of the industry.
                        I wanted the identity to have a playful and creative emphasis while keeping a strong sense of professionalism and detail.

            <p>With an identity established I went through several iterations before landing on a finished logo.
                The final mark began as an abstract use of the letter S in four directions.
                The logo consists of 4 curved teardrop shaped abstract marks.
                The abstract mark can be seen as small ghosts or a camera shutter utilizing the circular whitespace in the marks center.
                I chose Century Gothic for the type because the equality and symmetry between the forms gave a solid sophisticated form.
                But the perfect circles in certain letter forms helped to add that touch of playfulness.
                Finally, the logo was put into context with real world mockups and an <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/Oib6Qzoqb5c?si=0kjltilj656XYhBw" target="_blank">animated video.</a>
