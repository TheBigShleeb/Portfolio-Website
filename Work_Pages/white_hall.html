        <h2>White Hall<br></h2>
        <p>This logo was a project aiming at revitalizing an Alabama town by giving it a new logo.
          The process began with research. Looking into the town of White Hall led to small details that played an important part in the
          final design of the logo. I wanted to capture the rural peace of the town. The abstract mark in the logo symbolizes both the winding roads
          through the town and the river that runs through it.
          Using white space to represent those aspects the circular shape is split down the middle.
          The colors used are two shades of green to represent the nature that envelopes the town. The font I used in the logo was Century Roman.
          The strong serifs used in this type contrasted with the flowing curves in the mark. The also brought a refinement that can be
          reached by the name White Hall as well as the town hall which has tall pillars and a statue fountain. The font I used to compliment Century Roman was Futura.
          The two fonts have a strong contrast which brings the reader in. The smooth sans-serif Futura is also easily readable and compliments the smooth forms in the mark.

    <p>This was my first brand identity project and it came with many problems that required solving. Having a town chosen that for me
      that I was not particularly interested was one of them. At first glance the town lacked any real landmark to emphasize in a logo and
      it was not known for anything in particular. Because of this I had to take an alternate route. Visiting the town in person and getting
      a feeling for what it was like for the residence let me hone in on an idea. This project helped improve more than just my process though.
      I got stronger in Illustrator, with type systems and photoshop for the mockups.
