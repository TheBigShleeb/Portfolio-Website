        <h2>White Hall<br></h2>
        <p>This logo was a project aiming at revitalizing an Alabama town by giving it a new logo.
          There was a focus on form and meaning behind the logo mark. Research into the town of White Hall led to small details that played an important part in the

      The abstract mark can be seen as small ghosts or a camera shutter utilizing the circular whitespace in the marks center.
      I chose Century Gothic for the type because the equality and symmetry between the forms gave a solid sophisticated form.
      But the perfect circles in certain letter forms helped to add that touch of playfulness.
      Finally, the logo was put into context with real world mockups and
